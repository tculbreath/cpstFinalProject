# My Final Git Project
* Index.html page (LANDING PAGE AND HOMEPAGE)
    -
   + This page functions as my home page.  It is meant to welcome visitors and give them a brief summary of the pages they are able to visit.  There is also a nice image added and gradient design added for style. (I have more than two pages and for ease of use the initial landing page for the user works as a home page.  The can utilize this page to get back to all three and each following page has a home page button.)
        - The options on this page all include buttons with links that take them to that page.  The options to choose from are...
            + Due Date Calculator
            + Next Steps
            + Helpful Links
* DueDateCalculator.html ()
    -
    + The Due Date Calculator Page is the page where expectant parents can generate their due dates. I imported moments.js to help me calculate the dates.  When a person inputs the first date of the woman's last menstrual cycle the function then adds 280 days from that date to output the due date. The user also gets a count down to how much time is left.  There is also an image on this page as well as a link to additional information about the timeline of pregnancy.  

* NextSteps.html
    -
   + The Next Steps page gives the user more information about each stage of pregnancy where information is broken down by week, month and trimester.  This page is organized by three columns so that it is easier to read and utilize.

* HelpfulLinks.html
    -
   + The Helpful Links page contains link buttons and brief descriptions of sites that I have used and recommend. 
   
* Style 
    -
    + Bootstrap is used for styling and the callback can be found on the pages that are viewable for the user.
  
* Heroku and Git Repository
    -
    + The site is accessible through Heroku and has been pushed through. It is also backed up on the Git Repository.
    
* Moments.js
    - 
    + Moments.js has been installed saved and pushed for this project.
    
* Due Date Calculator Form and Functions
    -
    + Please see the due date page.  Each function will have a detailed breakdown of its purpose.
